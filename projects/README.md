# Projects

This directory contains major projects and applications. Each project typically includes:

- Complete source code
- Documentation
- Tests
- Build/deployment scripts

## Directory Structure

Each project should be organized in its own subdirectory:

```
projects/
├── project-name-1/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── src/
│   ├── tests/
│   └── docs/
├── project-name-2/
└── ...
```

## Adding a Project

Major projects with their own repositories can be included here either as:

1. **Submodules** - Link to the separate repository (recommended for active development)
2. **Snapshots** - Copy of the code at a specific point in time
3. **Archive** - Complete copy for preservation

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

*Projects will be listed here as they are added to the repository.*
